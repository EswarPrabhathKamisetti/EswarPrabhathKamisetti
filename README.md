### About

I’m a former dentist now driving evidence-based improvements in healthcare as a **Health Informatics graduate student at Indiana University**. From the operatory to the research lab, I’ve seen both the human and data side of healthcare—and I thrive at their intersection.

My mission is to use data to improve patient outcomes, streamline care delivery, and drive smarter decisions across healthcare systems. I bring experience in clinical practice, academic research, data engineering, and visualization—paired with a deep empathy for patient care.
